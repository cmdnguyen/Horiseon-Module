## Description

This is a module challenge created for bootcamp students. 
For this challenge, a starter code was given to the students who were tasked to make sure the website meets accessbility standards for a client. 
The client is a marketing agency who wants the website optimized for search engines.
I put the name of the marketing agency in the title of the head element. 
From the starter code, I added alt attributes to the images.
I also went into the HTML to divide each elements to make the code easier to read and find each section.
It's easy to flush out the code, but each section needed to be spaced out in case another developer goes into it to fix it.

## Installation

The starter code was found in the coding boot camp GitHub repo. I cloned the repo and put it in a new repo in my GitHub account.

## Usage

The website is used to show what I have learned so far as a bootcamp student. The best way to view it is on Google Chrome and you can inspect the elements in Chrome DevTools.
