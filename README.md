## Description

This is a website for a digital marketing agency. I was tasked to refactor the code to make it more accessible.

The code for the website did work. However, there were repeating lines of code in the HTML and CSS files. 

To make the codes easier to read, I added classes and id to distinguish for the CSS elements and deleted repeated codes in the CSS files. I also included alt attribute to help meet accessibility standards.

One of the challenges I've faced is checking the HTML structure. The code had missing tags, which affected the CSS styling for classes. Once I went back and looked at the elements, I was able to fix it and have the elements working again.

Here's the link to the website: https://cmdnguyen.github.io/Horiseon-Module/

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The website is used to show what I have learned so far as a bootcamp student. The best way to view it is on Google Chrome and you can inspect the elements in Chrome DevTools.
